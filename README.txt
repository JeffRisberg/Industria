Industria Theme, version 1.0  12/31/07

This theme is based on the layout of semiconductor chip topologies, with trace and connectors.
It has an industrial or high-tech design.

Supports two columns, and is widget-ready.  There is only one configuration option which indicates
if the author of each post is to be shown or not.
